# LED VU Meter – PCB Design Project

## Objective
This project involves the design, simulation, and prototyping of a 8-segment LED VU (Volume Unit) Meter for audio level indication. Developed as part of a university exam project at Politechnika Łódzka (Lodz University of Technology) within the MSc Double Degree in Electronic Engineering.

---

## Features
- Based on **LM3914** LED driver for linear analog signal indication
- Audio signal input via **3.5mm jack (J1)**, with amplification and conditioning
- **Dual Op-Amp LM358** for pre-processing the signal
- Adjustable luminous intensity via **potentiometer TS53YL502**
- 8 LED outputs (D1–D8) showing amplitude levels in real time
- Designed with **KiCad 9.0**, validated with **LTspice** simulations

## Tools Used
- **KiCad 9.0** – Schematic & PCB Layout
- **LTspice** – Signal conditioning and stage simulation
- **Excel** – Bill of Materials (BOM)
- **3D Rendering** – KiCad native viewer
