# VU-Meter-project
Designed a fully functional audio VU Meter based on the LM3914 driver. Created schematics and PCB layout in KiCad, simulated signal stages in LTspice, and selected components using a structured BOM. The project features adjustable gain and visual LED feedback, with all hardware integrated on a compact 2-layer PCB.
